( source can be found at wbcms.cc.buffalo.edu in maslib/games/imoria )

Started on nov 16, 1997.  Got the source, un-sharded it!
nov 17, actually started converting stuff.
nov 22, finished with most of the types/vars/values, time to recode!
dec 7,  you can create a character and get initial inventory and spells!

1998
march 1, you can actually play the game now

june, mid, Jeanetta started some alpha testing.  wow, lots of bugs.
	   Actually working on the code again (had to fix J's crashes)

july 10, I don't seem to be keeping this log up to date at all :)

	All but about 8 files are "done".

	No crashes in a while, except when loading damaged save files.
	encrypts save files, high scores work working on wizard
	commands (wizard passwords work now so you don't have to
	use gdb to set it)

	Master file is in place, uses gdbm.

	Insurance, Help and Trading Post are the only major things left

	(want to have a black market so single system users can benifit)

july 11:
	insurance is done

july 12:
	added encrypt and decrypt switches (-E and -D) for save files
	help is done

	running out of stuff before the post has to be done :)

july 13:
	moved everything up and left by one, icky macros do the job
	but I did not want to edit every single prt/print/..., fixed right
	edge

	get_char bails if any lines are bad.
	
	bolts and balls are visable now!

july 18:
	hmmm, done with the post.  is that everything?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.3
  july 20 1998		added reduced map and better Locate from umoria
			fixed store hours and bribes so correct index is used

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.4
  july 21 1998		fixed learn_spell and learn_prayer offering spell
			from outside correct range.

  july 24 1998          use Mersenne Twister random number library

  july 25 1998          cut about 30k from save files using run length encoding
			on the dungeon floor

			always xor save file data against random numbers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.5

  july and aug		I must have changed something between pl 4 and 5,
			but I have no idea what.

  sep 16 1998		announced package to freshmeat.net

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.6

Sep 27 1998

Fixes a crash in the speeded up identify selection code.<br>
Call endwin to clean up ncurses on exit.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.7

Sep 29 1998

Should fix a problem in monk.c where a for loop should have begun at 0.
Added break; to paladin, druid and priest spells so only one is cast
at a time.  I don't think I play them very often!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.8

Oct 05 1998

Made mhelp.pl output \n\r rather than just \n, should fix messed up output
when using help from within the game.
Replaced index call with strchr
Fixed bug in bi__insure_all_items that made the game look like it had hung.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.9

Oct 12 1998

Finished writing the put/take commands for bags of holding, and fixed
two bugs that showed up now that bags can be used.
Also finished the 'I' command (selective inventory) which had also been
skipped.
Staves of darkness no longer mess up the screen when used.
Enter can be used to reply to "-more-"
^M is still broken, getch returns 10 (^J) and I don't know why. Use 'V'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.10

Oct 14 1998

Now all the data files are checked before ncurses is given control of the
screen.  This should help all the people who have reported that the game
exits with no errors right after starting.
I also added a message if the help file could not be executed so the
screen does not just flash.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.11

Dec 5 1999

After a one year break I finally started playing again.
Reannounced on Freshmeat.

Fixed a big problem in compact_monsters that would create loops in 
the monster list (m_list).  This locks up the program fairly fast.
Also added USE_CURSES_ATTRS to configure.h to make it easy for the
people who have had problems with attr_get().  Some minor graphics
fixes including one caused by using the J command (parts of the map
were not redrawn correctly).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.12

Dec 13 1999

Fixed another bug in compact_monsters that was fixed in the 4.94 sources.
No loops in the list, but it still locked the game up for quite a while.
Show % full on bags of holding.
Interrupt rest when hunger messages are printed. This nearly killed me.
Sort magic/prayer/song books so you they are always in the same order.
Let petrification wear off over time, partly taken from the 4.94 sources.
Fixed message printed by area spells that killed things (monster names
were sometimes lost)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.13

Dec 18 1999

Fixed a huge problem where items that were removed by putting on something
else of the same type did not undo some of the magic bonuses.
Fixed a few item sets that caused crashes if DO_DEBUG was on.
Fixed an off by one problem with the material types of magic items.
Fixed some of the monster death messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.14

Dec 22 1999

Added a break; between Storm Giant and Cloud Giant Belts. Ooops.
Fixed % full description for empty bags of holding.  Do not strcat to
a string that has not been set yet!
Added '*' option for resting: rest until mana and hits are at maximum.
Chimes of disarming no longer cause chests to be empty.
When blindness ends show area around character.
Wand of wall building no longer pins creatures that do not move in water.
They are in a wall, not water!
Changed most of the floor_type checks to not use literals.
If a monster was in the dark, hit by something and cast teleport on itself
then the old position (shown when the monster was hit) was not redrawn.
I never noticed that at UW, but this week it happened at least 3 times. Odd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.15

Jan 7 2000

Fixed bug in starlight/light_line that would crash the game if the light
killed a creature before all of the power was used up.

Many thanks to Marc Lehmann for his patch to fix the attr_get call with
newer curses.  If things are still broken let me know.

Don't just detrap chests when disarming them, unlock them too.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.16

Jan 31 2000

Fixed blessed blades so they set the correct flags.

Fix weapon useage penalties for priests and rangers.  Now priests have
some and rangers do not.

Fixed number of blows per attack code, integer math can cause terrible rounding
errors.  Monks will be helped a lot by this.

Fixed genocide, it usually went into an infinite loop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.17

Feb 17 2000

cloister wrote item_guide.txt, a guide to the treasure_type struct.

replaced a bunch of constant tvals with horn, chime, instrument, etc.

fixed spelling in check for Amethyst, now they cost more.

items inside chests will be created at a level near where the chest was
found rather than at the level the chest is opened.

moved all the potion2 and scroll2 effects into flag2.

added valuable_gems to things that can be recharged.

wizard_create will let you create anything now (including traps!).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.18

Oct 15 2000

correctly set random seed in casino so that it does not always play
exactly the same games after loading a saved character.

A bunch of little things I did back in March that I have forgotten about.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.19

Oct 26 2000

Applied some patches from cloister.  Here are his notes:

i found three bugs related to timekeeping when spending time in the inn plus a
couple of other little bugs.

1. careful observation of the dates in the game reveals that spending time in
   the inn, no matter how many days you pay for (1, 3, 7), always gets you only
   1 calendar day, due to a bug in misc.c's add_days() function.  you did,
   however, get the correct number of loops through store_maint, the correct
   adjustments to player flags, etc.  it's just py.misc.cur_age that wasn't
   updated correctly.  fixed add_days.
2. having fixed add_days, there was a bug in spend_time() when you buy 3 days
   in the inn.  check out the add_days() call that was there.  i have no idea
   what the original programmer could have been thinking...
3. having fixed #2, the p1 value on the "3 days in the inn" item in values.h
   was also wrong.  it was set to '30', not 3.  my only guess is that
   originally someone wanted to have an option for spending a month in the
   inn (which, now that i think about it, would also explain bug number 2, if
   the person was trying to emulate--albeit poorly--months of slightly
   differing length).
4. the druid Ring of Fire spell didn't work analagously to the mage version or
   the version you get when you use the "broken set of teeth from a dragon"
   item.  fixed.
5. the price when selling rings of protection and rings of increase-to-hit was
   based on the rings' +todam value.  looks like a cut-and-paste error,
   probably from when those rings were invented originally...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.20

June 6, 2001

Patches from John Guthrie to fix various things:

Fix help message about what flags exist.
Fix *Enchant Armor* scrolls so they actually enchant armor.
Fix a bunch of item prices in the stores that depended on how identified the item is.
Fix mhelp.pl to be smarter about figuring out how many lines are on the screen.
Fix gain_mana() so it does the right thing on even level ups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.21

May 28, 2002

Additional patches from John Guthrie (from Oct 2001, work got busy):

Correct the Reputation and Swimming values in the character printouts.
Fix the learn_* functions to not segfault when picking new spells.
Fix more problems with enchant armor.
Spell dispel correctly.

Also, NetBSD patches from Ben Wong:

io.c
This patch is necessary since on NetBSD, using setgid is final; if you
give up privileges you can't get them back. Setegid is the way to go
since it only changes your effective gid. I believe this change should
work fine under Linux as well.  [ kertes: I tested this breifly, and
had no trouble. ]

term.c
This patch fixes a few problems in term.c. Primarily, it makes it
#include <sgtty.h> instead of <termios.h>. It also has some of the
#ifdef code cleaned up a bit since I couldn't figure out the multiply
nested conditional macros. Finally, it fixes a non-portable way of
using curses: I believe using stdscr->_cury is deprecated. I replaced
it with getcury(stdscr), which hopefully will work everywhere.

unix.c
This patch is necessary since on NetBSD, the symbol "unix" is no
longer automatically defined by the compiler. However, __NetBSD__ is.
Again, this should work fine under Linux. (If the #includes cause a
problem, they can be removed; they are only to prevent warnings from
gcc).

Also includes his patches for the Makefile and configure.h in the NetBSD
directory.

Added some code to bother to check the length of the DATA_FILE_PATH rather
than just trusting people to notice that segfaults are caused by long
paths.  And I upped the max path length to 170 chars from 60 to accommodate
NetBSD packages installed without root access.  I hope that is plenty, it
was certainly lazy.  But at least it checks for overflows now!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.85.22

Aug 20, 2003

Fixed printing of water in the P command and fixed a buffer overflow
if you change OUTPAGE_WIDTH cover the full map.

Proved that I still maintain the code if someone emails me a problem.
Thanks Robin!  :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
