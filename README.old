I finally wrote a README file.

Making imoria:

Edit configure.h to set the paths you want the data files to go and
were the help file (mhelp.pl) will be.

Put a copy of monsters.dat into the DATA_FILE_PATH, and move mhelp.pl
to the propper place as well.

In the Makefile edit the owner and group to use for the game and data files.
Also pick how the mtwist library will be linked to imoria, the default is
as a shared library.  The Makefile has a lot more imormation about this.

run "make mtwist"
run "make imoria"

the first time you run imoria it should make a bunch of data files and
then quit.  I run "make privs" to fixup the file ownership and privileges,
since the Makefile does not know where the data files are at this may
not work correctly for you (I do intend to make this better).


Common problems:

Several people are having a problem running the game where it quits
right after starting, without any error messages.  Two problems have
been found that cause this.  The first is not having copied monsters.dat
to the data files directory that is set in configure.h.  The second
is if ncurses does not like the default terminal type.
