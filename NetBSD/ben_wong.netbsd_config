Subject: imoria patch: NetBSD configuration

You won't want to apply this patch. It changes configure.h to install
the files in the /usr/pkg hierarchy, and to disable the Mersenne
twister. It also turns off the "USE_CURSES_ATTRS" since it wasn't
compiling nicely with the standard BSD curses. (I don't know if using
ncurses would have made it work, but I poked at it a bit and it didn't
seem to help).

What do I lose by not having USE_CURSES_ATTRS? Is it worth fixing?

[ kertes: Various status indicators like blind/hungry/confused get drawn
  in bold or blinking if they are important.  The game plays the same
  without USE_CURSES_ATTRS, I just like to make sure I see that I'm about
  to die of hunger. ]
