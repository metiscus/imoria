In May 2002 Ben Wong sent me some patches to help build imoria on NetBSD.
Changes that were easy to include in the main codeline have already been
applied.  Makefile and configure.h changes have been left out.

This directory has the original email he sent me for those two files,
I don't have NetBSD installed anyplace so I haven't tested them.

Enjoy,
