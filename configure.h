  I don't know what to use to get and set the attributes with the
  newer library so change this to 1 if you want to try the nifty
  attr changes I added.  Otherwise you can leave it set to 0 and
  always wonder what the game could be like...

  This is only used in put_buffer_attr (term.c).  If you get it working
  with a curses that it does not currently work with please let me know!
